# TinyDB Archive

Before TinyDB took a life of its own, it started as a little database module
of a side project (see [TinyDB: Past, Present & Future](https://m-siemens.de/blog/2016/01/tinydb-past-present-and-future)
for the backstory). This repository contains the complete history of TinyDB
before it was split out into a separate project (hosted at https://github.com/msiemens/TinyDB).
